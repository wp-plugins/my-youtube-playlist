Custom playlist from youtube with thumbnails, loads youtube clips without reloading your page.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a youtube video and a list of thumbnails of your choice. The thumbnails are clickable and replaces the youtube video without reloading the page. The interface is fully customizable from the css.

All you have to do to add a list to your post is to add a line like this:
[myyoutubeplaylist LO3n67BQvh0, WGOohBytKTU, iwY5o2fsG7Y, PyKNxUThW4E, 1cX4t5-YpHQ, SJ183htYl-8, eWwoHPrrJYY, bja2ttzGOFM]

The id's like "LO3n67BQvh0" for instace is youtube-clip id's. LO3n67BQvh0 is the clip found at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO3n67BQvh0, so to show a youtube-clip simply take part of the url after "v=". Then simply add more id's separated by ", ".
